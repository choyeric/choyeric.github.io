My name is Eric Choy, and I am currently a student at UH Manoa. I am majoring in Accounting, Finance, and MIS. When I had graduated high school, I knew I was going to either major in engineering or business, thus choosing the former. Ultimately I decided that engineering was not for me and switched to business two years ago with plans to focus in Accounting. Once I got to UH, I was advised to major in multiple areas to have a stronger resume and appeal for future jobs, thus deciding to triple major as it would also allow me to get enough credits for my CPA.
